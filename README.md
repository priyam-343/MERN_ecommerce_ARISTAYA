ARISTAYA E-commerce Backend
This is the robust backend application powering the ARISTAYA E-commerce Platform. It's built to handle all the heavy lifting, from user authentication and product management to secure payment processing and admin controls.

Features
This backend provides a comprehensive set of APIs to support the frontend application:

User & Admin Authentication: Secure JWT-based authentication for both regular users and administrators.

User Management: APIs for user registration, login, profile updates, and account deletion. Includes features for email verification (powered by Firebase) and a secure forgot/reset password flow.

Admin Controls: Extensive endpoints for administrators to manage products, users, orders, and reviews. This includes:

Centralized user management: View user profiles, carts, wishlists, and reviews.

Admin approval system: New admin registrations require approval from a super-admin.

Product CRUD: Create, read, update, and delete product listings.

Analytics: Provides data for dashboard statistics, including revenue, order trends, and user activity.

Dynamic Free Shipping: Admins can toggle free shipping eligibility for individual users.

Product Catalog: APIs for fetching products by type, category, or individual ID.

Shopping Cart & Wishlist: Manages user carts and wishlists, allowing items to be added, removed, and fetched.

Secure Payment Processing: Integrates with Razorpay for handling payments, using a robust webhook system as the single source of truth for transaction statuses.

Email Service: Integrated mail service for order confirmations, password resets, and admin approvals.
